# Numerical-Analysis-for-finance
This is a collection of python code about pricing options using monte carlo and variance reduction techniques.
During our computation, we consider an asset with a price process $$(S_t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$$ satisfying :

$$
S_t= S_0e^{(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t}
$$ 

with $$(W_t)_{t \geq 0 } $$ a standard brownien motion.
