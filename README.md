# Numerical-Analysis-for-finance
This is a collection of python code about pricing options using monte carlo and variance reduction techniques.
During our computation, we consider an asset with a price process <span class="tex2jax">$(S_t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$</span> satisfying :

$$
\large S_t= S_0e^{(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t}
$$ 

with <span class="tex2jax">$(W_t)_{t \geq 0 }$</span> a standard brownien motion.
